               <h1>about me</h1>
               <p>Hi I'm Sophie! But you might know me better under the name Summer. I strive to achieve greatness and have massive goals for the future. I'm currently working towards achieving my dreams of being a lawyer or a phycologist. My absolute dream career is being a singer though. I've fought and pushed over the years to achieve this dream. My goal is to have a group called Crown! The girl-group has been living rent free in my head for over 4 years. My experiences have led me to be here because of crown and because of how much I've pushed to be successful. I've always wanted to be successful It's something I've fought for, something I'm passionate about. Experiences like bullying and being outcast has made me strive to prove them wrong. I never give up and have the will to succeed.    
I am working towards these goals by graduating Highschool, keeping good grades and remaining focused on what's at the other end of the tunnel and the success that will come with it. The hardship and the hurt will all be worth it when success comes out of this. The values I consider most necessary to succeed is my iron will. I have never given up and that can be a blessing and a curse. I can talk my way out of anything but I tend to not pick and choose my fights wisely. My main success is going to come from the fact that I never give up. The best example of this is Crown, Crown has been something I've fought for since I was only 10. I have full on songs written and I had a stage and everything else planned out at the age of 11 but then covid happened. Getting through the rest of the school year has been a short term goal of mine, another short term goal I have is too be better with my binging, like not restricting and eating 3 meals a-day instead of 1 huge meal. while hurting myself. The character traits I want to be most known for is my iron will and my kindness. I wanna be most well known for my talents and my iron will. I want to be known for how much I've achieved at such a young age. I wanna be known for being smart and strong. I wanna be someone worth remembering.</p>
